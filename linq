LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is uniform query syntax in C# and VB.NET to retrieve data from different sources and formats.

Advantages of LINQ
Familiar language: Developers donâ€™t have to learn a new query language for each type of data source or data format.
Less coding: It reduces the amount of code to be written as compared with a more traditional approach.
Readable code: LINQ makes the code more readable so other developers can easily understand and maintain it.
Standardized way of querying multiple data sources: The same LINQ syntax can be used to query multiple data sources.
Compile time safety of queries: It provides type checking of objects at compile time.
IntelliSense Support: LINQ provides IntelliSense for generic collections.
Shaping data: You can retrieve data in different shapes.

Extension methods
Extension methods in C# allow us to define a static method that appears to be a member of another type, any type, classes, interfaces, 
  structs, even sealed types that we can't extend using inheritance.
